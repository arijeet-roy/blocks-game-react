A basic "escape the blocks game" built using ReactJS. This was my first hands on with the React library hence decided to build a small game on top of it. Players need to prevent their block from comming in contact with the incoming enemies which varies in speed and number as the time progresses.

----Steps to run on your machine----

Clone the repository.
Make sure npm is installed on your machine and do "npm install".
"npm run" to start the server at http://localhost:8081/
In case port 8081 is already in use, change the port number in "webpack.config.js"
Enjoy! (A score of 500+ is really challenging to score.)

----Future Enhancements---- 
Add a global scoreboard so as to track the global high score.
